# Pictionary Cards Generator

I couldn't find a pictionary anywhere in the city, so I decided to print one myself. I wasn't going to type all those words and names manually into Photoshop though, so I made this - a pictionary cards generator written in Python 3, using the Pillow graphics library. In its current form, it generates 100 cards across 7 A4 international paper size sheets, ready to print.

## Requirements

Requires Pythong 3.x, [Pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html#simple-installation) and the [Hans Kendrick font](http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/hans-kendrick).

## How to use

To use the default word list, navigate to your cloned repo directory and then place the Hans Kendrick font into `resources`. Then, just run `./generate` in the terminal. You may need to `chmod +x generate` to give the file permissions to execute. If you'd like to modify the words that appear on the cards, look in /word-lists/ and modify the text files.

By default uses `medium.txt` for "All play" and `hard.txt` for "Difficult" (`easy.txt` unused).

## Extras
There's also a PSD of a board in `resources` that you can print to play the game. It fits on an A3 piece of paper.

## The final product looks like this
